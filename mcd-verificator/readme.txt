This test program was made for CD core accuracy verification. mcd-verificator tests various system functions and checks if their behaviour matches to real hardware. Some tests just checks well known functions described in sega docs, but some other checks unclear system conditions which seem not beed described in details anywhere before. mcd-verificator is fully  based on real hardware researches.

Program can be executed on emulator or on real hardware. There is two way for using it:
1. Replace CD bios with mcd-verificator and run it as CD bios
2. Run it as regular cartridge game with attached mcd (mcd mode1)
